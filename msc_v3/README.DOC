                                    Release Notes
          
          
          This document contains information related to Version 3.00 of the
          Microsoft C compiler and libraries for MS-DOS.  This document
          contains information which is more up-to-date than the printed
          manuals.  As a result, where information in the manuals conflicts
          with information in this document, this document should be
          assumed to contain the correct information.
          
          The drivers contain two new features which are not documented in
          the manuals:
          
          1.   the addition of /help and /HELP options to both the CL and
               MSC drivers.  If this option is specified, a list of the
               most commonly used options, together with a short
               description of their effect, is printed on the screen.  The
               options are grouped together by general function, with
               headers to identify each group.  Note that not all of the
               available options are given, only the most common ones.  See
               appendices B and C of the Users Guide for a more complete
               list of the options available for MSC and CL.
          
               Following the list will be a line which says
          
                    "type any character to continue"
          
               if you are using MSC, or
          
                    "type any character to exit"
          
               if you are using CL.  When using CL, after a character is
               typed, the driver returns to the DOS command level.  Other
               inputs on the command line are ignored.  When using MSC
               however, the driver will process all information on the line
               containing the /help (either the command line or a response
               line for one of the prompts), and re-issue the current
               prompt for further input if needed.  Note that any input
               given up to this point has been processed so, for example,
               if you had typed a filename followed by the /help option,
               that filename will show up as the default value when the
               prompt is re-issued.  The only exception to these rules is
               for source file names.  If the source file name was given
               together with the /help option, the source file prompt is
               NOT re-issued, but instead the object file prompt will be
               the next one given after the help menu is listed.
          
          2.   in the CL driver only, typing "CL <ret>" will cause CL to
               print a usage prompt indicating the general form of the
               input to CL.














          There are three undocumented object files on your diskettes.
          They are SVARSTCK.OBJ, MVARSTCK.OBJ, and LVARSTCK.OBJ.  These are
          the small, medium, and large model versions of a routine which,
          when linked into your program, will allow the memory allocation
          functions (malloc, calloc, and realloc) to allocate items in
          unused stack space if they run out of other memory.
          
          Normally programs compiled and linked under Microsoft C run with
          a fixed stack size (default size is 2048 bytes).  The stack
          resides above static data and the heap uses whatever space is
          left above the stack.  However, for some programs a fixed stack
          model may not be ideal, and a model where the stack and the heap
          compete for space is more appopriate.  Linking with the
          xVARSTCK.OBJ routine (where x is appropriate for the memory model
          you choose) gives you a similar environment.  The heap can grow
          until it runs out of memory, then it will try to use unused stack
          space.  If it runs into the top of the stack, it fails.  The
          stack, however, cannot grow to an unlimited size, but only to the
          size it was given at link time.
          
          There is another undocumented file on your diskettes and that is
          sieve.c.  This is a version of the standard Sieve of Eratosthenes
          benchmark program.  We invite you to compile this program with
          Microsoft C Version 3.00 and compare the size and speed of the
          generated program with the executable program generated by any
          other C compiler for MS-DOS.  We think you will be pleased with
          the results.
          
          There have been several recent changes to the behavior and
          capabilities of the EXEMOD and EXEPACK programs provided on this
          release which are not covered in the printed manuals.
          
          EXEPACK attempts to prevent you from compressing a file onto
          itself.  It is not infallible - it can be fooled by a statement
          of the form:
          
               EXEPACK TEST.EXE .\TEST.EXE
          
          If it detects an attempt to compress a file onto itself it will
          issue the message:
          
               "exepack: cannot pack file onto itself"
          
          and exit with return code 1.  Also, when using EXEPACK to
          compress an .EXE file with overlays, the compressed file should
          be renamed back to the original name of the linked file to avoid
          the overlay manager prompt (see Overlays in the User Guide).



















          EXEMOD has an undocumented switch, /h, which can be seen in the
          usage prompt (it is not shown in the Users Guide description of
          the usage prompt).  This option CANNOT be used with any of the
          other options, and it is equivalent to typing:
          
               EXEMOD PROG.EXE
          
          That is, it simply displays the header fields of the .EXE file
          without modifying them.
          
          EXEMOD has also been modified to work correctly on packed (via
          EXEPACK) files.  When it recognizes a packed file, it will print
          the message:
          
               "exemod: (warning) packed file"
          
          If the stack value is changed, it modifies the value that SP will
          have AFTER expansion.  If either min or stack is set, min will be
          corrected as necessary to accomodate unpacking or stack.  Setting
          max operates as it would for unpacked files.
          
          If the header of a packed file is displayed, the CS:IP and SS:SP
          values are displayed as they will be after expansion, which is
          not the same as the actual values in the header.
          
          The compiler executable files (CL, MSC, P0, P1, P2, and P3) are
          not packed on the distribution diskettes.  We recommend that when
          you set up your own diskettes (as recommended in the manual or
          otherwise), you run EXEPACK on all the compiler executable files.
          The savings is not great on most of them, but it is about 11K for
          P2.EXE!
          
          If your machine has an 8087 or an 80287, you should read this
          closely to see if this pertains to your hardware configuration.
          All Microsoft languages which support the 8087 need to intercept
          8087 exceptions in order to correct bugs with the chip to produce
          accurate results and properly detect error conditions.  Most
          other languages vendors do not bother to correct or even detect
          these errors.  The math libraries which contain the 8087
          exception handler and emulator (EM.LIB and 87.LIB) are designed
          to work without modification with the following machines:
          
               IBM PC family and compatibles, Wang PC, AT&T 6300
                    (any machine which uses NMI for 8087 exceptions)
               Texas Instruments Professional Computer
          
          There is a source file EMOEM.ASM included with the release that
          can be modified.  Any machine which sends the 8087 exception to
          an 8259 Priority Interrupt Controller (master or master/slave)
          should be easily supported by a simple table change to the
          EMOEM.ASM module.  In the file there are further instructions on
          how to modify the file and patch libraries and executables.














          There are several issues which have caused some confusion to
          users which are not covered in the documentation.  We will try to
          cover some of those here in order to (hopefully) save some time
          and frustration later on.
          
          1.   When using the stat.h, utime.h, or timeb.h include files
               (all found in the SYS subdirectory), remember that types.h
               (also in SYS) must being included PRIOR to any of the three
               include files above.
          
          2.   When passing standard device names, (e.g. CON or LPT1) to
               any of C runtime routines which handle device names (creat,
               open, sopen, fopen, freopen, or stat), trailing colons in
               the names (e.g. CON: or LPT1:) are NOT supported.
          
          3.   Non-standard MS-DOS/PC-DOS environments (such as some
               commonly used networks) often intercept some/all DOS system
               calls and handle them themselves to provide some
               additional/different capabilities.  When running the
               compiler under such environments, this different operation
               of the system calls may cause some functions to differ from
               their documented behaviour.  For example, compiler temporary
               files may not always removed when you use ^C or ^BREAK to
               terminate a compilation.  Changes in the way the PATH is
               handled, may cause open, for example, to find (or fail to
               find) a given file name where it would fail (or succeed) on
               a standard DOS environment.
          
          4.   In order for some of the buffered file IO routines,
               primarily fseek and ftell, to operate reasonably on TEXT
               mode files (where carriage return-linefeed (CRLF) pairs are
               translated to linefeed (LF) only on input and LF is
               translated to CRLF on output), an assumption is made that
               TEXT files DO NOT contain stand-alone LF characters (0x0A in
               the ASCII table).  If you have files which contain only LF
               characters as line separators you should either process them
               in BINARY mode, or you must write a filter which can read
               the file in BINARY mode, and write it back out in TEXT mode,
               which will expand the LF's to CRLF pairs on output.  The
               resulting file can then be processed as a TEXT file.  If you
               do not use fseek/ftell, this restriction is not required.
          
          5.   If you use the system() library function to invoke a new
               COMMAND.COM and do a DOS SET command, a new environment
               variable ";C_FILE_INFO" has been created to pass open file
               information to child programs.
          
          6.   The FP_SEG and FP_OFF macros in DOS.H have been modified so
               that they can be used to get or set the segment and offset
               portions of a far pointer.
















          When reporting problems with the compiler we ask that you please
          provide the following information to help us in tracking down the
          problem:
          
          -    the compiler version number (from the logo that is printed
               out when you invoke the compiler via CL or MSC)
          
          -    the version of DOS you are running (use the DOS VER command)
          
          -    your system configuration (what machine, total memory, total
               free memory at compiler execution time, etc.)
          
          -    the command line used in the compilation
          
          -    a preprocessed listing of the program (produced via any of
               the -E, -P, or -EP switches), or if the problem appears to
               be in the preprocessor, the C source(s) and ALL include
               files referenced
          
          -    all objects/libraries (except standard ones, but please
               state which standard objects/libraries you are using) needed
               to link, if necessary
          
          Having that information will be of immense help to us in solving
          your problem quickly.
